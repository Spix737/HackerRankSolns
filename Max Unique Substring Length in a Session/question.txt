Max Unique Substring Length in a Session

Given a string of lowercase letters with sessions separated by '' characters, find the maximum length of a substring with all distinct letters within any single session.

Example

Input

sessionString = abcabcbb

Output

3

Explanation

- There is only one session: "abcabcbb". 
- Scanning with a sliding window for distinct letters, the longest substrings without repeats are "abc", "bca" and so on, each of length 3. 
- Therefore, the result is 3.

Input Format

    A single line containing the string sessionString.

Constraints

    0 <= S.length <= 100000
    For all i in [0, S.length]: S[i] is either '*' or a lowercase letter 'a' to 'z'
    Each session is defined as a maximal contiguous substring of S without '*' characters
    Number of sessions (segments between '*') is at most S.length + 1

Output Format

    A single integer denoting the maximum length among all substrings. If sessionString is empty or contains only '*', output 0.

Sample Input 0

*

Sample Output 0

0

Sample Input 1

aa

Sample Output 1

1

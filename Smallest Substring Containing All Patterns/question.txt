Smallest Substring Containing All Patterns

Given a string S and an array of patterns, find the smallest substring window [l, r] such that each pattern appears at least once within S[l..r]. Return the pair of indices or [-1, -1] if no such window exists.

Example

Input

S = xyzabcabczyx
patterns = ['abc', 'zyx']

Output

[6,11]

Explanation

- Identify occurrences of 'abc' at indices [3..5] and [6..8], and 'zyx' at [9..11]. 
- Combining the second 'abc' ([6..8]) with 'zyx' ([9..11]) yields the window [6,11] of length 6, which is shorter than the alternative [3,11], so the result is [6,11].

Input Format

    The first line contains an integer n denoting the length of array patterns
    The next n lines contains the elements of the array.
    The last line contains the string S.

Example

2
abc
zyx
xyzabcabczyx

Constraints

    1 <= |S| <= 10^6
    1 <= m <= 10^5
    1 <= |patterns[i]| <= 10^5 for each 1 <= i <= m
    all patterns[i] are non-empty strings
    patterns may contain duplicate entries

Output Format

    Returns an integer array of length 2
